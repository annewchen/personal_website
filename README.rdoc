== My Website

This is my personal website used to display my contact information, projects, resume, and blog.

The homepage portion was built with Rails and jQuery. Rails was not an easy framework to build a personal website with but I wanted more practice with it.

This website also includes a blog made with the jekyll gem and SASS, a CSS extention language.
