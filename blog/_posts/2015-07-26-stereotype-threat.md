<h2>"Girls can't do math..."</h2>

Stereotype is defined as believing unfairly that all people or things with a particular characteristic are the same. This topic is going to relate closely with one of the problems in the tech industry, diversity. Because there is a stereotype that women are not good at computer science, not many choose to pursue those degrees. As a result, the tech industry has a less diverse pool to hire from.

Now looking at stereotype threats in general, the one about how girls can't do math hits closer to home. Personally there was a point in middle school where I found math hard, particularly pre-Algebra. I guess my case is unique as there were 2 stereotypes affecting me. The stereotype that Asians should do well in math pushed me to work harder and learn the material. So for me, the Asian/math stereotype affected me more than the girl/math stereotype. One worked to push me harder and luckily that was the one I associated with. But in the end, I realized that math was just like any other subject. Once you understand it, there is that indescribable feeling of accomplishment.

As a mathematics tutor, I had a lot of experiences with girls in high school who struggled in math because they gave into that stereotype. The most memorable student who suffered from this was actually one of my Psychology professor's daughter. My professor knew that I was double majoring in math so she asked me to tutor her daughter to prove that the stereotype was false. Her daughter came into tutoring believing that she 'sucks at math'. She realized quickly that she was simply not studying enough. Just putting in an extra 1.5 hours a week to review made her grades shoot up. She had pushed herself down even before she began due to believing in the stereotype.

As you can probably tell, I have a lot to say about this subject but I wanted to bring this back around to tech. Just like with math and girls, there is a stereotype about tech and girls. It's no secret that there are less women who pursue a STEM (science, technology, engineering, or math) degree. They are further discouraged when those who do choose to take that path end up suffering in their work environment from other who do not believe that the women can perform as well. But just like with any issues, the first step is to admit that there is a problem. Just as the problem of diversity in tech is getting more attention, so is stereotype threat as a result. I can only hope that just by realizing when one is stereotyping will help prevent one from stereotyping in the future.
