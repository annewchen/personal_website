<h2>"I'm going on an adventure!" -<em> Bilbo Baggins</em></h2>

So I just finished watching [Shereef's Fireside Chat][fireside-chat] and the main point that I got was:

Devbootcamp is a place where you come prepared to take a hold of your own learning - do not expect to be spoon-fed knowledge.

Of course the learning environment will be different than the learning environment of traditional schools. In schools, there is a wide variety of students who do not all have the same interests. Not all students will find every topic worthwhile. Why would they go out of their way to further their studies with research and join these knowledge communities when they barely want to learn the topic? DevBootcamp on the other hand is made up of people who want to learn coding. This type of environment is what anyone would dream to be a part of. The most rewarding type of learning is the kind where you do not want to stop and that happens when everyone around you is working towards a common goal. Nothing excites me more than a teacher who is passionate about what they are teaching and students who are passionate about absorbing lessons and willing to further their knowledge on their own.

I am definitely nervous about challenging this program but the moment Shereef mentioned common fears, I felt so much better! Upon hearing that some people were starting with the fear that they were accepted into DBC on accident, I burst out laughing! It was a perfect description of how I feel right now: scared of not having enough coding knowledge, scared of holding people back, etc. It was a great relief to hear that I'm not alone in my paranoia. I think I will always have a fear that my knowledge is not enough because obviously, it is not enough. But that is not going to stop me, in fact it challenges me to prove to myself that I can do it. I'm definitely looking forward to the next 18 weeks.
